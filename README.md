# flock-tagg-client-sidebar
Build for an Internal Hackathon on the FlockOS platform

The app is basically a tagging feature where any type of communication on Flock can be tagged with meta info.

For example a shared log file can have a LOG tag, making it easy to find.

These tags are attached to the message throughout it's lifecycle. Tags can even be carry forwarded and/or edited when forwarding the messages.

The feature make's information more manageable on Flock and easily searchable.
